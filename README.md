# User_Version
The user friendly version of the depth and segmentation model 
All the code, images and models are stored in the master branch of the repository. The branch contains everything required to run and test the model on the images provided. 
To run, download the files from the master branch. Ensure the images maintain their nested directory structure e.g. MainFolder/left/left/Image001.png when running the model.


Running either User-FriendlyStirling.ipynb or MonkaaUserVersion from the top level of the directory that contains the images should allow the model to automatically sort the images, define the model, load weights, make predictions and visualise the results.


FullMonkaaModel & FullStirlingModel contains the raw models and weights that can be utilised for inference without the original python code.
